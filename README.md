This is a Q-learning based A.I. which plays the game of Nim.

I briefly summarize this project on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5JMfz7Cezk

The game can be downloaded as .exe here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/18erfKSAVOg-p5ps8_mE71s69ZOTJIKZg/view?usp=sharing (extract the .zip file and then open the gui.exe file).

If you want to play the game without the .exe file, just clone this repo and run the gui.py file.


Credits to Brian Yu and his Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Course. This is where I have the idea as well as parts of the code from.
